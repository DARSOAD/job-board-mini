WordPress Job Board Assessment

This repository contains the two main deliverables for the technical assessment:

A custom WordPress plugin named Job Board Mini

A custom WordPress theme named Career Portal Theme

These two components are designed to work together to build a lightweight job board with a dynamic, styled homepage.
